Perform importance-weighted moment matching, adapting a sample from a proposal distribution
to more closely match the target distribution.

# Arguments
  - `log_target`: The log-pdf of the target distribution. This should be a function having
  θ, a vector of parameters, as its input; and `x`, the data set, as its second input.
